Plan route	entity, mcsp, routeSchedulingAlgorithm:
	routes = routeSchedulingAlgorithm mcps count entity
	update(entity, routes = routes)
	send message(entity, routes)

Task:
	collectors = Database.Retrive collector infos()
	janitors = Database.Retrieve janitor infos()

	mcps = Databse.Retrive mcp infos()

	Plan route collectors, mcps, TSP
	Plan route janitors mcps KMeans
	
Send message entity, routes
	for person route in entity, routes:
		send (route => person)

retrieve information about MCPs (their location and traveling distance to other MCPs)

retrieve number of available collectors
from MCP information and number of collector, plan routes using Ant Colony algorithm
message collectors about their routes
 
retrieve number of available janitors
from MCP information and number of janitors,  plan routes using KMean algorithm
message janitors about their routes
